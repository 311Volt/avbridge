This command line tool can transform between audio files and editable spectral
images with no audible loss in quality, enabling for existing image processing
techniques to be used for audio manipulation.

Example use case: removing an annoying high-pitched sound with Photoshop's
content-aware fill

## reupload note
Re-uploaded to github.com/311Volt in 2022. I made this project in 2019
(file timestamps indicate late June-early July) and if you're looking to
use it, be aware that it is a complete mess without any documentation
whatsoever, as I only developed it to the point where I got any results
at all. (I think that even the input/output filenames were hard-coded).
I'm not ready to declare this project dead just yet, I learned a lot 
since then and am still interested in making this a usable and 
documented thing when I find some time to get around to it.
